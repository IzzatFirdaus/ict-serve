# Helpdesk Complaint Management Flowchart

This flowchart illustrates the sequential process for handling a user complaint from its submission to its resolution. The process involves interactions between the user, an automated system, and an administrator.

---

## Detailed Process Flow

The process is initiated by the user and follows a linear path to completion, with the system handling notifications automatically.

1. **Start (`Mula`)**
   - The process begins at this point.

2. **User Submits Complaint (`Pengguna Hantar Aduan`)**
   - A user submits a complaint to the system.
   - This step requires the user to fill out a form and select a category for their complaint.

3. **System Sends Confirmation Email (`Sistem hantar emel`)**
   - The system automatically sends an email to the user (the complainant).
   - This email serves as a confirmation that the complaint has been received.

4. **System Forwards Complaint to Administrator (`Sistem hantar aduan kepada Pentadbir`)**
   - The system forwards the submitted complaint to the Administrator.

5. **Administrator Receives Notification (`Pentadbir terima emel notifikasi aduan`)**
   - The Administrator receives an email notification about the newly submitted complaint.

6. **Administrator Reviews and Takes Action (`Pentadbir Semak & Ambil Tindakan`)**
   - The Administrator reviews the complaint's details and proceeds to take the necessary action to address it.

7. **Action Taken (`Tindakan Diambil`)**
   - This step represents the completion of the action required to resolve the complaint.

8. **Complaint Status Updated (`Status Aduan: Selesai`)**
   - The status of the complaint is formally updated to "Completed".

9. **System Sends Resolution Email (`Sistem hantar emel`)**
   - The system sends another automated email.
   - This email informs the complainant that their issue has been resolved.

10. **End (`Tamat`)**
    - The complaint process is now complete.
