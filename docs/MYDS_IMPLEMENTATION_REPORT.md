- Improved focus ring implementation with proper offset
- Enhanced accessibility attributes
- Better adherence to MYDS color specifications

### Validation Framework

- Created automated compliance checking
- Continuous validation for future development
- Clear error reporting and guidance
- Integration with development workflow

## Developer Resources Created

1. **`docs/MYDS_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide referencing all shared markdown files
2. **`docs/MYDS_DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`** - Step-by-step checklist for developers
3. **`scripts/validate-myds-compliance.php`** - Automated validation script
